# Quantum Computing Course Projects

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Course Projects repository! This repository contains the projects I completed as part of a quantum computing course. The projects include completing some of the Xanadu notebooks from the Xanadu Quantum Codebook and implementing a code for RSA factorization.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Xanadu Quantum Codebook Notebooks

This section contains my completed notebooks from the Xanadu Quantum Codebook, covering various topics in quantum computing such as quantum gates, circuits, and algorithms.

### 2. RSA Factorization Code

In this project, we implement a code for RSA factorization. The implementation includes the following:

- **Code Generation Routine**: Generates RSA keys similar to the routine found in Xanadu's codebook.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Functions**: Detailed implementation for encrypting and decrypting arbitrary numbers with examples.
- **Running Time Analysis**: A graph showing the running time of factoring numbers of growing size, identifying hard and easy instances.
- **Quantum Fourier Transform**: Using the Quantum Fourier Transform over a simple quantum state to crack a simple key of 6 bits.
